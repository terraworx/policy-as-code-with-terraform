# Policy as Code with Terraform

### Course Description:

This course introduces students to the concept of policy as code, which involves using the Sentinel language to automate the creation, implementation, and enforcement of policies. Students will learn how to write policies using a common policy as code language such as Sentinel and how to apply those policies to real-world scenarios. The course will also cover best practices for policy as code, including version control, testing, and documentation.

### Course Goals and Objectives:

* Understand the concept of policy as code and its applications in different domains.
* Learn how to write policies in common programming languages.
* Gain hands-on experience with implementing and enforcing policies using policy as code.
* Understand best practices for version control, testing, and documentation of policies as code.

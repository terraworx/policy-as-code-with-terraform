description: What is policy as code?

# Overview

Policy as code (PaC) is an approach to managing policies that allows organizations to define and enforce their policies as executable code. PaC enables organizations to automate policy compliance checks and ensure that their policies are consistently applied across their infrastructure.

With PaC, policies are written in a machine-readable language and stored in a version-controlled repository. This allows policies to be treated like software code, with the same benefits of version control, automated testing, and collaboration. Policies can be tested and validated before being deployed to production, reducing the risk of errors or misconfigurations.

PaC tools can also integrate with other infrastructure-as-code tools, such as configuration management and orchestration platforms, to enforce policies at runtime. This ensures that policies are consistently enforced across all environments, from development to production.

Overall, PaC helps organizations to improve security and compliance, reduce human errors, and increase efficiency by automating policy enforcement.
